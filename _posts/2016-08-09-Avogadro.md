Happy 240th birthday, Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro di Quaregna e di Cerreto!  Is it any wonder we call you Avogadro for short?

Avogradro is most famous for Avogadro's law, which states that at the same temperature and pressure, the same volume of a gas will contain
the same number of molecules of that gas, no matter which gas it is.  Using this, it's possible to calculate the number of
molecules in a gram of hydrogen, which came to be known as Avogadro's number, roughly 6.02214179Ã—10<sup>23</sup>

This is my first attempt hosting new content here, let's see how it goes...
