Happy 160th birthday, William Willett!

Willett is known as the [inventor of Daylight Savings Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Willett), which has
been a headache for people twice a year, and an endless source of 
[software bugs](http://www.cnet.com/news/wake-up-to-the-daylight-saving-bug/), 
while [providing scant actual benefit](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomzeller/2015/03/06/daylight-savings-time-negligible-energy-savings-possibly-deadly/#3e3da19841a3).

At least we can be glad that his original idea didn't take hold, which was that 4 Sundays in a row in April would see
clocks set 20 minutes forward, followed by 4 Sundays in October in which the clocks would move 20 minutes back.
