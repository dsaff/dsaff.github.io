While [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) is widely recognized as the first computer programmer, sadly, the programs she wrote were for a computer which was never built, Babbage's [analytical engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).

Kilburn worked on the Small-Scale Experimental Machine, which was the first computer that could run a program stored in its own memory.  In this case, the memory was "written" on a phosphor screen, using the same technique used for cathode-ray televisions.

The program Kilburn wrote was run on June 21st, 1948.  It factored an input integer using repeated subtraction (because the logic unit of the SSEM only implemented addition and subtraction).
